You know Rojo? Yeah, you can say ARMATO is similar to that. Don't compare ARMATO to Rojo though, only I can do that*.

## Features
- Two way sync from Roblox to local files and vice versa
- Sync in real time
- A lot more Instances (like all** Roblox Instances: TextLabel, Part, Frame; you know? Not just Folders, Scripts and that.)

  

## Get Started
- Download ARMATO CLI, and add ARMATO to your system environment variable's path thing.

**New Roblox game project**
- `armato init [name]`
- `armato serve`

**Already have a Roblox game project**
- `armato init [name] -c`
- `armato serve`

`[name]` is optional. By providing a name, ARMATO will create a new directory else ARMATO will use the current directory's name.

## Notes
- I do not know how to use : and ;
- engrish no very good

\* *Just kidding*
\*\* Maybe not all :)
